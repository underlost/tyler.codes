      <p class="lead">For 2018, I'll be providing assistance to other creatives, indie developers, minorities, or small organizations that may not be able to afford my normal rates.</p>
      <p>Each month I'll be allocating roughly 10-15 hours of my time to assist with consulting and development at no charge. For areas of expertise and ways I may be of service, please see the <a href="/work/">Availability section</a>.</p>

  <div class="layout-single-column fadeLeft">
    <h4 class="heading"><span>How to Apply</span></h4>
    <p>Simply send me an <a href="mailto:tyler@underlost.net">email</a> with the following information:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>Name of your organization / group</li>
      <li>A brief description of yourself / organization.</li>
      <li>Month/dates when you would require my assistance.</li>
      <li>What you need assistance with and why you think I might be able to help</li>
      <li>Any other information you may think to be pertinent (urls, about the project, etc)</li>
    </ul>

    <p>I'll try to respond to all enqueries within 48-72 hours. If you don't hear back, please don't take it too personal, and feel free to try again at a later date.</p>
